# A VBA Challenge


## **Overview of Project**
A recent finance graduate, Steve, needed some stock data analysis for his parents. He provided the data to analyze in an excel sheet. In order to automate the analysis, the VBA was used. Initial script calculated quite quickly the total volume and yearly return for dozen of stocks and for last few years. It is, however, not sure whether the code would work on much larger dataset - thousands of stocks. Even, it could take a long time to execute. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor a VBA code for stock data analysis and measure the performance. 


## **Results**
Original and refactored script can be found here:

Stock performance is the same for the year 2018 regardless of the VBA code used. As per the execution times, the VBA script seems to run very slightly faster using the original VBA script.

## **Summary**

    What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
    How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
